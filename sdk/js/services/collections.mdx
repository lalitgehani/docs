The Collections service allows you to create, read, update, and delete collections.

## Overview

```ts
import { SnackBaseClient } from "@snackbase/sdk";

const client = new SnackBaseClient({
  baseUrl: "https://api.example.com",
});

// Access the collections service
const collections = client.collections;
```

## List Collections

```ts
const result = await client.collections.list();
```

## Get a Collection

```ts
const collection = await client.collections.get("collection-id");
```

## Get Collection Names

```ts
const names = await client.collections.getNames();
```

## Create a Collection

```ts
const collection = await client.collections.create({
  name: "posts",
  description: "Blog posts and articles",
  fields: [
    {
      name: "title",
      type: "text",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "content",
      type: "text",
      required: false,
    },
  ],
});
```

<Note>
  To update the fields of a collection, you typically need to create a
  migration. See the Migrations service for more details.
</Note>

## Update a Collection

```ts
const updated = await client.collections.update("collection-id", {
  description: "Updated description",
});
```

## Delete a Collection

```ts
await client.collections.delete("collection-id");
```

<Warning>
  Deleting a collection permanently deletes all records within it. This
  action cannot be undone.
</Warning>
