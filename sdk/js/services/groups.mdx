The Groups service provides methods for managing user groups.

## Overview

```ts
import { SnackBaseClient } from "@snackbase/sdk";

const client = new SnackBaseClient({
  baseUrl: "https://api.example.com",
});

// Access the groups service
const groups = client.groups;
```

## List Groups

```ts
const result = await client.groups.list();
```

## Get a Group

```ts
const group = await client.groups.get("group-id");
```

## Create a Group

```ts
const group = await client.groups.create({
  name: "Editors",
  description: "Content editors team",
});
```

## Update a Group

```ts
const updated = await client.groups.update("group-id", {
  name: "Senior Editors",
});
```

## Delete a Group

```ts
await client.groups.delete("group-id");
```

<Note>
  Deleting a group removes it from all users. The users themselves are not
  deleted.
</Note>

## Add User to Group

```ts
await client.groups.addUser("group-id", "user-id");
```

## Remove User from Group

```ts
await client.groups.removeUser("group-id", "user-id");
```

```ts
const members = await client.groups.getMembers("group-id");
