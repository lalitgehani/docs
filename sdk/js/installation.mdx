The SnackBase JavaScript SDK provides a type-safe, feature-complete interface for interacting with SnackBase from JavaScript and TypeScript applications.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the SDK, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** or a compatible runtime
- **npm**, **yarn**, or **pnpm** for package management
- A SnackBase instance (local or hosted)

## Installation

### npm

```bash npm
npm install @snackbase/sdk
```

### yarn

```bash yarn
yarn add @snackbase/sdk
```

### pnpm

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @snackbase/sdk
```

### React Integration

If you're using React, you'll also need React installed as a peer dependency:

```bash npm
npm install @snackbase/sdk react
```

<Note>
  The React integration is exported from the same package (`@snackbase/sdk/react`)
  and requires React 18 or higher.
</Note>

## Platform Support

The SDK works across multiple JavaScript environments:

| Platform          | Support Level | Notes                           |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Modern Browsers   | Full          | Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge   |
| React Native      | Full          | Uses AsyncStorage for tokens   |
| Node.js 18+       | Full          | Server-side rendering, APIs     |
| Next.js           | Full          | Both App and Pages routers      |
| Vue/Nuxt          | Full          | Via the core SDK                |
| Svelte/SvelteKit  | Full          | Via the core SDK                |

## TypeScript Support

The SDK is written in TypeScript and includes full type definitions. No additional `@types` packages are needed.

```ts
import { SnackBaseClient } from "@snackbase/sdk";

// Full autocomplete and type safety
const client = new SnackBaseClient({
  baseUrl: "https://your-project.snackbase.dev",
});
```

## Bundle Size

The SDK is optimized for production use:

- **Core SDK**: 14.87 KB (gzipped)
- **React Integration**: 1.42 KB (gzipped)
- **Total**: 16.29 KB (gzipped)

## Verification

After installation, verify the SDK is working:

```ts
import { SnackBaseClient } from "@snackbase/sdk";

const client = new SnackBaseClient({
  baseUrl: "https://your-project.snackbase.dev",
});

console.log("SnackBase SDK version:", client.getConfig().version);
```
